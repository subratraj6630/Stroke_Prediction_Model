# Stroke_Prediction_Model

## Project Overview

- This project aims to predict the likelihood of a brain stroke based on various health parameters.
- It uses machine learning models to analyze input data and provide a risk assessment.

## Features

- User-friendly interface for inputting health data.
- Real-time visualization of stroke risk using a dynamic chart.
- Clear risk status indicators for better understanding.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Chart.js for visualization).
- **Backend**: Flask framework for handling requests and integrating the machine learning model.
- **Machine Learning**: Trained model for stroke prediction using health datasets.

## How It Works

1. Users input their health parameters.
2. The backend processes the data and predicts the stroke risk using the trained model.
3. Results are displayed with a risk percentage and visual indicators.
